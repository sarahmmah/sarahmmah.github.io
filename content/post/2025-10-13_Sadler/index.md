Abstract: The Flint Water Crisis was the result of decades of deliberate disinvestment and state government ineptitude. In this talk, Dr. Sadler will discuss how the crisis unfolded, and how his research-examining environmental exposures, neighborhood conditions, and blood lead levels-revealed its scale. He will also address what has changed in Flint since then, including the massive new investments in the city that have brought hope in the wake of catastrophe.

Biography: Richard Sadler is an associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine who engages in public health research in Flint. He earned a BSc in Environmental Science and Planning from the University of Michigan-Flint and a PhD in Geography from the University of Western Ontario. His research focuses on advancing our understanding of how the built environment influences health behaviors and outcomes, with the goal of shaping land use policy to build healthier cities.
