abstract: "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication whose prevalence is rising worldwide. Using population-based administrative health data from Ontario (2015–2021), this study found that age-standardized GDM prevalence increased by 35%. Prevalence declined during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to forgone screening, but rose again the following year. GDM prevalence was higher with older age and lower income, though these disparities did not worsen over time. Findings highlight the growing burden of GDM on the health-care system, especially for lower-income populations."
summary: "From 2015–2021, gestational diabetes prevalence in Ontario rose by 35%, with disparities by age and income persisting but not worsening. A temporary dip occurred during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, likely reflecting reduced screening."
