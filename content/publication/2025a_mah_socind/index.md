abstract: "Where we live, how often we move, and where we move to have direct impacts on health and well-being. However, there is still a need for comprehensive data and robust approaches to assess long-term residential mobility and population-wide health. Our study demonstrates that longitudinal linked tax and survey data can be used to produce reliable population-wide measures of residential mobility. *(To read more, please visit the links above.)*"
