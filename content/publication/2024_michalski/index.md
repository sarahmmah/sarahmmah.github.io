abstract: "Background Community belonging, an important constituent of subjective well-being, is an important target for improving population health. Ageing involves transitioning across different social conditions thus, community belonging on health may vary across the life course. Using a nationally representative cohort, this study estimates the life stage-specific impact of community belonging on premature mortality.

Methods Six cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2000–2012) were combined and linked to the Canadian Vital Statistics Database (2000–2017). Respondents were followed for up to 5 years. Multivariable-adjusted modified Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risk of premature mortality for three life stages: early adulthood (18–35 years), middle adulthood (36–55 years) and late adulthood (56–70 years).

Results The final analytical sample included 477 100 respondents. Most reported a ‘somewhat strong’ sense of belonging (45.9%). Compared with their ‘somewhat strong’ counterparts, young adults reporting a ‘somewhat weak’ sense of belonging exhibited an increased relative risk (RR) of 1.76 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.43) for premature mortality, whereas middle-aged adults reporting the same exhibited a decreased RR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.69, 0.98). Among older adults, groups reporting a ‘very strong’ (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01, 1.21) or a ‘very weak’ sense (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01, 1.28) of belonging exhibited higher RRs for premature mortality.

Conclusion The results demonstrate how community belonging relates to premature mortality differs across age groups underscoring the importance of considering life stage-specific perspectives when researching and developing approaches to strengthen belonging."
summary: "Community belonging influences premature mortality differently across life stages, highlighting its role as a population health determinant."
