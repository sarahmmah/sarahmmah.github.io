abstract: "Using population-based healthcare administrative data linked to immigration and neighbourhood census data, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of all people aged ≥ 40 years with diabetes in Ontario, Canada on 1 April 2019. ...[Findings suggest] that the gap in quality of care between immigrants and non-immigrants is not simply due to differences in these social determinants of health, and highlights the intersecting impact of immigration and marginalization. *(To read more, please visit the links above.)*"
